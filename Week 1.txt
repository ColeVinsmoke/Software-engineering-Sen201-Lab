Software engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. It combines principles from computer science, mathematics, and engineering to create reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions. Unlike simple programming, software engineering emphasizes structured methodologies, such as agile or waterfall, to manage complex projects and ensure high-quality outcomes.

Software engineers use a variety of tools and programming languages to build everything from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems. They also focus on problem-solving, debugging, and optimizing performance, while considering factors like user experience, security, and scalability. Ultimately, software engineering is about creating software that not only works but also meets the needs of users and businesses in a sustainable way.
